# ReTap: ReTune's updrsTapping toolbox

### Summary
This toolbox enables automated accelerometer-based assessment of UPDRS-tapping tasks, performed in clinical Parkinson-assessment routines.
The toolbox will provide 1) an automated prediction of UPDRS-subscore of a 10-second fingertapping task, and 2) provide detailed movement
features which can help the clinician or researcher to assess motor performance and bradykinesia.
